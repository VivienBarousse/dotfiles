This is a collection of my dotfiles, nothing interesting to read in there
I'm afraid.

The rest of this README is mostly for me to remember how to set up those
dotfiles on new machines.

Installation
============

Initialise and download submodules (mainly for VIM plugins):
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Symlink the files in place:
$ ./setup.sh
