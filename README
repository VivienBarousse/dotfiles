This is a collection of my dotfiles, nothing interesting to read in there
I'm afraid.

The rest of this README is mostly for me to remember how to set up those
dotfiles on new machines.

Installation
============

Download the repo:
$ git clone git@github.com:VivienBarousse/dotfiles.git

Download submodules and symlink the files in place:
$ ./setup.sh
